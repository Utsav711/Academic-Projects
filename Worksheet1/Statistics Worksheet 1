10. It's a distribution which is symmetric about the mean and explains through graph that data close to mean is more frequent than the one away from it. It's also called a gaussian distribution. The graph is a bell graph.
11. one can use various data imputation techniques, regression analysis and deletion methods. Using mean or median to replace Nan values, and CCA in some cases of low input variables. 
12. It is basically a randomized control test. It's a way to compare 2 kind of variables and find out which performs better in a controlled environment. its based on hypothetical approach of making decisions that estimate population parameters.
13. Yes, but only when the dataset is limited or is a small dataset. With larger dataset , outliers can actually deviate the mean to an unwanted direction making mean imputation an unviable solution.
14. Linear regression is a problem solving approach which creates a linear relationship (y = mx+c) between independent and dependent variables.
15. Descriptive and inferential statistics.
