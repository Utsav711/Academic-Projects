13. This type of regression is used to reduce overfitting of the machinea learning model.
This works by adding an additional weight to the error function of the model. It controls the variabilities of the function so coefficients dont take intense values.

14. Ridge Regression (L2), Lasso Regression(L1) and Elastic-net 
15. An error term is basically a value that tells us how different is the predicted value from the actual value.
